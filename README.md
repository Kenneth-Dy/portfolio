# Portfolio

This portfolio is to show the skills I've learned after one week in my coding boot camp. It's to demonstrate basic html and CSS knowledge while using a CSS framework to assist my work. I used the Bulma framework as my chosen CSS framework.

The project consists of an index page that contains an about me section and links to my social media pages. A portfolio page to show my projects, which is currently a dummy page that doesn't show anything. I will update them with actual links to projects as I complete them over the course of the boot camp. Lastly is the contact page which is also a dummy page that will at some time will have actual functionality. 

Enjoy looking at my work: https://kenneth-dy.github.io/portfolio/
