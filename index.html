        <p class="block">My name is Kenneth Dy and I go by Ken most of the time. I'm currently enrolled in the UC Irvine Continuing Education Coding Boot Camp learning how to be a full stack developer. I'll be done with this course by April 2021 where I hope my skills will be great and I can start contributing to the giant infrastructure of the internet. This site is meant to show my skills as I learn more and more about web development with my portfolio and my continuing update of this site in general. 
        </p>
        <p class="block">
          For fun I enjoy attending music festivals and shows. I feel that the energy in the crowd can't be beat and just gets me jumping of my feet. I also enjoy musicals and make it a point to go to the theater and watch a show at least once every six months. Just like festivals I get drawn into the music and the actors on stage. Another thing I enjoy is video games escpecially rpg's and shooters. I enjoy relaxing either playing by myself or with friends online.
